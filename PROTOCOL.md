## Sample Preservation

### For DNA Analysis

Tissue samples should be preserved in 95% ethanol for long-term storage. Use sterile forceps to place samples in cryovials filled with ethanol. Store at -20°C if possible, otherwise at 4°C. Label vials with unique sample IDs, date, location, and depth.

### For Morphological Analysis

Specimens intended for morphological identification should be fixed in a 10% buffered formalin solution for 24–48 hours. Use a formalin-to-specimen volume ratio of at least 10:1. After fixation, rinse specimens with distilled water and transfer to 70% ethanol for long-term storage. Label containers with unique sample IDs, date, location, depth, and fixation details.
